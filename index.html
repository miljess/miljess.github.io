<p>Johnathan Dean Thurston (born 25 April 1983) is an Australian professional rugby league footballer and captain of National Rugby League team the North Queensland Cowboys. During his NRL career he has frequently been cited as rugby league's best player and arguably the greatest player to ever play the game. Thurston is an Australian international, Queensland State of Origin and Indigenous All Stars representative halfback, five-eighth and goal-kicker. In 2015 he became the first ever four-time Dally M Medallist for the NRL season's best player and later that year became the first ever three-time winner of the Golden Boot Award for the World's best player.</p>

  <h1>2015 NRL </h1>          
1st half: After an even opening five minutes, the first points of the game were scored by the Broncos in the sixth minute, when a Cowboys handling error in midfield followed shortly by a penalty allowed Corey Parker to kick a 40-metre penalty goal. The Broncos then returned the first tackle after the restart for the opening try of the game, after a late offload on his own ten-metre line from Adam Blair to Anthony Milford allowed Milford to set up a line-break down the left wing, culminating in a try to Corey Oates; Parker converted the try and Brisbane led 8–0. The Broncos then knocked on shortly after the restart, and North Queensland scored its opening try from the ensuing scrum set piece, with Jake Granville breaking the line to set up Justin O'Neill for the try; Johnathan Thurston converted and Brisbane led 8–6. North Queensland nearly scored again three minutes later, with Oates making a try-saving tackle on Kyle Feldt after a pass from Lachlan Coote.

Over the ensuing fifteen minutes, North Queensland had the better of possession and field position. In the 24th minute, attacking from a repeat set which had followed a grubber kick, James Tamou took the first pass out of dummy half and scored under the posts; Thurston converted the try to give North Queensland a 12–8 lead. Brisbane scored an opportunistic try in the 34th minute, when Thurston lost the ball in a tackle in North Queensland territory, and Matt Gillett recovered for Brisbane and broke the line to put Jack Reed over for a try; Jordan Kahu converted and Brisbane regained a 14–12 lead which it took to half time.








2nd half
Jordan Kahu scored a penalty goal in the 43rd minute to give Brisbane a 16–12 lead. From that point, the game played out as a defensive battle in Brisbane territory. North Queensland had the better of possession and territory, and generated several repeat sets in attack, but the Cowboys were unable to score due to a combination of their own erratic attacking play and Brisbane's stout goal line defence. Brisbane actively sought to defend its lead, kicking for touch on sixth tackle throughout most of the second half to kill the clock and manage fatigue. North Queensland's two closest opportunities came in the 61st minute, when Kane Linnett dropped a cut-out pass from Thurston which would have seen Linnett score; and in the 64th minute, when Coote was tackled around the legs by Gillett just short of the try line – Coote reached out to put the ball over the line and was penalised for a double movement.

With four minutes remaining, and the ball deep in North Queensland's territory, Ben Hunt conceded a penalty for a dangerous lifting tackle on Linnett, giving North Queensland field position. North Queensland failed to score on the ensuing set; but on Brisbane's following set, the Broncos failed to get to a sixth tackle kick, after Feldt stripped the ball one-on-one from Hunt at midfield on fourth tackle with one minute remaining. North Queensland attacked, and on the sixth tackle, Michael Morgan ran to the right side, cut in to draw three Brisbane defenders, then flicked a short outside pass to Feldt who scored just inside the right corner as time expired. Thurston's attempted game-winning conversion hit the near upright and bounced out, leaving the game tied at 16–16.






Extra time
North Queensland kicked off first in extra time, and the opening kick-off was knocked on by Ben Hunt, immediately giving North Queensland an attacking scrum on Brisbane's ten-metre line. North Queensland set up for the game-winning field goal, and after aborting attempts on the first and third tackles due to strong defensive pressure from the Broncos, Johnathan Thurston scored with the short-range field goal on fifth tackle to win the game 17–16.
